About
=====

I created this tool from a running instance of pyzo and saved the module inside of ~/.pyzo/tools folder and then reloaded all the tools from the Tools menu in the main menu bar. A new entry appeared and upon clicking it a Dockable widget was displayed. I was thrilled to see this in action. Clicking the tool menu item again made the dockable widget become invisible.
